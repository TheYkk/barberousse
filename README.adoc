= Barberousse - Remote Secrets Editor

A project aimed to avoid downloading secrets from remote providers (support only AWS Secret Manager for the moment).
Opens an editor with the content of the secret readily editable, upon save & exit, the secret is automatically uploaded
and a new version created remotely. This way, no need to use common bad-practices such as versionning secrets in a VCS
or worst, storing them on your machine and sending them via slack :)

NOTE: This project is at its earliest stage a project can be, i.e. a proof of concept that might or not develop into a full
fledged project.

== Printing
Cat your secret in a nice format

== Editing
Allows you to edit a remote secret without saving it on disk (a temp file is created though... a more secure way to handle temp files will come in the future). You can use different formats to edit your secret (json, yaml, plain text):
